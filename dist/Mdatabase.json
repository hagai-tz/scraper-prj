The decision undoes a previous ruling from the board decided under the Obama administration, which gave workers more latitude to use their work email for legally protected labor activity.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"z4q7VU\"><q>&#x201C;employees have no statutory right to use employer equipment.&#x201D;</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"UUWp5E\">The decision, which was based on a Las Vegas casino&#x2019;s email policy, was recommended by attorneys for Google in cases brought to the labor board. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/google-urged-the-u-s-to-limit-protection-for-activist-workers\"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported earlier this year</a>, Google told the board that the Obama-era standard &#x201C;should be overruled&#x201D; and a broader, pro-employer ruling reinstated. A Google spokesperson told the outlet at the time that the company was &#x201C;not lobbying for changes to any rules&#x201D; and included the position as one point in a wider legal defense against claims the company considered meritless. </p>\n<p id=\"c4EA7m\">Google has been roiled by employee activism in the past two years, and much of the work has been organized internally, with Googlers posting on internal message boards about protests. But the ruling will have effects well beyond any one company.</p>\n<p id=\"ZwlyZX\">The lone dissenting labor board vote on this week&#x2019;s ruling said the NLRB &#x201C;aims to turn back the clock on the ability of employees to communicate with each other at work.&#x201D;</p>\n\n\n</div></div></div>",

Shares of key Tata group companies &#x2013; Tata Motors slipped 3.05 per cent to Rs 174.70 on the BSE, while that of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ended 0.07 per cent higher at Rs 2,167.25 and Tata Steel settled 1.16 per cent higher at Rs 444.60 on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year in January, Cyrus Investments &#x2013; is the investment firm of Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, had contended to the tribunal that Cyrus Mistry was removed as the chairman of Tata Sons <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/cyrus-investments-to-nclat-tata-sons-board-removed-mistry-just-like-that-5529382/\">against the company&#x2019;s Articles of Association (AoA).</a></p>\n<p>Cyrus Investments had also urged for the modification in Tata Sons&#x2019; AoA, particularly Article 75, which empowers it to ask minority shareholders to transfer their shares.</p>\n<p>The SP Group had also earlier requested the NCLAT to order amending Article 121 of the Tata Group&#x2019;s Articles of Association, alleging that the article was helping Dorabji Tata Trust and Ratan Tata Trust, part of the Tata Trust, to govern the whole Group even as they are the minority shareholders.</p>\n<p>Mistry was removed as Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016. He was the sixth chairman of Tata Sons and had taken over in 2012 after Ratan Tata.

Per the survey, 21% of total respondents said they signed up for <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/disney-plus/\" id=\"auto-tag_disney-plus\">Disney Plus</a> in November, suggesting the 24 million customer base exiting the month. That would blow away previous Wall Street forecasts for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/features/youtube-facebook-ad-supported-video-originals-strategy-1203440823/\" id=\"related_article_link_disney\">Disney</a> Plus, which had pegged less than 20 million subs worldwide for 2020 even after factoring in expected lift from the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-plus-already-signed-up-verizon-free-unlimited-wireless-customers-1203379631/\">one-year-free offer from Verizon for certain customers</a>.</p>\n<p>While some research has indicated <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-plus-22-million-mobile-app-downloads-1203432731/\">Disney Plus has had minimal impact on Netflix</a>, Cowen &amp; Co. estimated that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/mandalorian-episode-7-questions-baby-yoda-1203446445/\" id=\"related_article_link_disney-plus\">Disney Plus</a> will result in about 1 million additional U.S. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/reviews/soundtrack-netflix-review-musical-1203447344/\" id=\"related_article_link_netflix\">Netflix</a> customers cancelling service for the fourth quarter of 2019. All told, about 5.1 million Netflix subs in the States will bail in Q4, but the higher churn &#x201C;appears manageable&#x201D; for Netflix, Cowen analysts led by John Blackledge said in the report issued Wednesday.</p> <p>&#x201C;The incremental churn uptick [for Netflix] appears reasonable given the Disney+ launch, which has been highly publicized and includes various marketing programs, including a Verizon promotion that offers Disney+ for free for one year,&#x201D; the analysts wrote.</p>\n<p>For Q4 2019, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-q3-2019-earnings-subscriber-growth-1203373186/\">Netflix forecast 7.6 million global paid net adds</a>, comprising 600,000 in the U.S. and 7.0 million for the international segment. Cowen&#x2019;s current estimates put Netflix net adds for the current quarter at 500,000. The analysts pointed to Netflix&#x2019;s &#x201C;strong&#x201D; content slate for Q4 as helping minimize the blow from Disney Plus, including high-profile originals like &#x201C;The Irishman,&#x201D; &#x201C;Marriage Story,&#x201D; &#x201C;6 Underground,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Two Popes&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Crown&#x201D; Season 3.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it&#x2019;s worth noting that a large swath of Disney Plus users in the U.S. are currently not paying for the service.</p>\n<p>About one-third (34%) of Disney Plus&#x2019; U.S. customers &#x2014; or 8 million as of the end of November &#x2014; are on <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-plus-already-signed-up-verizon-free-unlimited-wireless-customers-1203379631/\">one-year-free offer from Verizon for certain customers</a>, while the remaining 66% are on paid plans, Cowen&#x2019;s analysts estimated. It&#x2019;s possible Disney Plus could see a tsunami of churn once the Verizon freebie deals roll off in late 2020. In addition, the Cowen survey data indicated there were about 19.4 million consumers who subscribe to both Netflix and Disney Plus, implying an 80% overlap between the services.</p>\n<p>Disney last month said <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-says-disney-plus-has-over-10-million-signups-1203403515/\">over 10 million users had signed up for Disney Plus</a> as of Nov. 13 (the day after launch). The company said it doesn&#x2019;t plan to release any additional Disney Plus subscriber data outside of quarterly earnings calls.</p>\n<p>Netflix&#x2019;s subscriber growth in the U.S. &#x2014; its most mature market &#x2014; has slowed in recent quarters. The streamer this week <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-breaks-down-results-by-region-showing-strong-asia-pacific-europe-growth-1203440307/\">released its first breakdown of the international business by region</a>, showing strong growth and potential upside in Asia-Pacific especially. Netflix&#x2019;s penetration in Latin America is higher than Wall Street previously believed, with 29.4 million customers in the region (30% of its international base) as of the end of Q3.</p> <p>With big new rivals coming to market, Netflix has sought to reassure investors it can weather the storm. &#x201C;Many are focused on the &#x2018;streaming wars,&#x2019; but we&#x2019;ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade,&#x201D; the company wrote in its <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/netflix-competition-hulu-disney-plus-apple-plus-1203373259/\">Oct. 16 letter to shareholders</a>. &#x201C;The upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV.&#x201D;</p> </article>",
